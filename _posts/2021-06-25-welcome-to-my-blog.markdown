I have to admit, I'm 32 years old and I haven't published anything about my work or my enthusiasm for software engineering. I've been thinking about this for a while, and decided that 2021 is the year to put my thoughts into bytes on GitHub Pages :)

I started my software engineering career in 2010 at an IT startup. A rookie, 0 mile developer with full of enthusiasm, passionate about the industry, and doing anything to be a better software engineer day by day.
